# Sensirion SPS30

## ===========================================================

A program to set instructions and get information from an SPS30. It has been
tested to run either UART or I2C communcation on ESP32, MEGA2560, ESP8266 and UNO.
<br> A detailed description of the options and findings are in SPS30.odt

## Getting Started
As part of a larger project I am looking at analyzing and understanding the air quality.
I have done a number of projects on air-sensors. The SPS30 sensor is a new kid on the block
that looks interesting. This is the first version of a working driver + examples.
More work to be done to create examples and compare against other sensors.

A word of warning: the SPS30 needs a female plug of ZHR-5 from JST Sales America Inc.
I have not been able to find a good source for that and was glad to buy the Sparkfun version
(https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15103) which does include a cable with this plug.

## Prerequisites
Examples 4, 5, 7 and 8 have a dependency on other libraries. Documented in sketch

## Software installation
Obtain the zip and install like any other

## Program usage
### Program options
Please see the description in the top of the sketch and read the documentation (odt)

## Versioning

### version 1.0 / January 2019
 * Initial version Arduino, ESP32, UNO

### version 1.0.1 / January 2019
 * Added examples 4 (with DS18x20) and 5 (with BME280)

### version 1.1.0 / January 2019
 * Added example 6 (plotting data)
 * Added ESP8266 support info

### version 1.2  / January 2019
 * added force serial1 when TX = RX = 8
 * added flag INCLUDE_SOFTWARE_SERIAL to optionally exclude software Serial
 * Tested by Ryan Brown on a Sparkfun Photon RED board and the code should also work with the Photon, P1, and Electrons

### version 1.2.1 / February 2019
 * Added example 7 (with SCD)
 * Added flag in sps30.h SOFTI2C_ESP32 to use SoftWire on ESP32 in case of SCD30 and SPS30 working on I2C
 * Update documentation / instructions

### version 1.3.0 / February 2019
 * Added check on the I2C receive buffer. If at least 64 bytes it try to read ALL information else only MASS results
 * Updated examples / documentation / instructions
 * Added example 8 (SPS30 + SCD30 + BME280)
 * Added || defined(__AVR_ATmega32U4__) || defined(__AVR_ATmega16U4__) for boards with small footprint (thanks Just van den Broecke)

### Version 1.3.1 / February 2019
 * fixed the PM10 number always showing 0 issue.
